Hi there! I'm Naseem Dillman-Hasso, an Environmental Social Sciences PhD Candidate at (the) Ohio State University. I'm currently advised by [Dr. Robyn Wilson](https://senr.osu.edu/our-people/robyn-s-wilson) and [Dr. Nicole Sintov](https://senr.osu.edu/our-people/nicole-sintov). I'm particularly interested in understanding motivations for pro-environmental behavior, and promoting persistent behavior change through interventions.
